        "Nonlinear System of Fractional Partial Differential Equations (NSFPDEs) have received significant attention in various fields such as chemistry, physics and engineering due to their ability to model various phenomena. Recently, an effective analytic method known as the Fractional Power Series Method (FPSM) which employs the Mittag-Leffler function in one parameter, has been applied by researchers across the globe to obtain the exact solution of the NSFPDE in a functional space. In fact, the exact solution of the NSFPDE is consistent and reliable due to the involvement of the parameter $\\alpha$, in the Mittag-Leffler function. However, the Wright function which incorporates two parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as well as an $n$ factorial have not been used to solve NSFPDEs. Undoubtedly, incorporating the Wright function in the FPSM provides a more generalized and continuum solution to the NSFPDE. Similarly the Raina function which generalizes the classical Mittag-Leffler function and the Kummer function has not been incorporated in the FPSM to obtain the exact solution to the NSFPDE. In this paper, two modified methods known as the Wright Fractional Power Series Method (WFPSM) via the Wright function and the Raina Fractional Power Series Method (RFPSM) via the Raina function are observed to obtain the exact solution to the NSFPDE in a functional space. Interestingly, when these two methods are applied independently to solve the NSFPDE, they yield the same infinite series in a more general form that converges to the exact solution of the NSFPDE in a functional space. Again, choosing $\\alpha=1$, $\\beta=1$ and $\\lambda=1$, both the WFPSM and the RFPSM provide the same exact integer solution to the NSPDE, making the newly introduced methods having exact general solution compared to the FPSM. The comparison analysis among the WFPSM, the RFPSM and the Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM), the Variational Iteration Method (VIM), the Double Laplace Decomposition Method (DLDM) prove that the WFPSM and the RFPSM converge faster to the exact solution as compared to the existing methods.\n",
